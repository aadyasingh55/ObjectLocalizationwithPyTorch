## Introduction
Object localization involves identifying and locating objects within images. This project showcases the implementation of object localization techniques using a combination of custom dataset handling, image augmentation, and convolutional neural networks.

  ## Project Overview
  The project involves the following key steps:
  
  1. Dataset Preparation: Custom dataset class is created to handle image-bounding box data. The dataset is structured for object localization tasks.
  
  2. Augmentation: The Albumentations library is utilized to apply augmentation techniques such as flips, rotations, and color adjustments. Augmentation plays a crucial role in increasing the diversity of the training data.
  
  3. Model Selection: A pre-trained convolutional neural network is loaded using the Timm library. This model serves as the base architecture for the object localization task.
  
  4. Training Loop: Custom training and evaluation functions are developed to train the model and assess its performance.
  
  5. Object Localization: The trained model is used to predict bounding boxes around objects in images.

## Dataset

## Augmentation
Augmentation is a key aspect of training a robust object localization model. The Albumentations library is used to apply various image transformations and augmentations. Augmented images are paired with their corresponding bounding boxes, ensuring consistency.

## Training
The training process involves feeding the augmented images to the model along with their associated bounding box coordinates. The model learns to predict the correct bounding box coordinates for objects in the images.

## Results
The project demonstrates how to effectively prepare a custom dataset, apply augmentation, and train a convolutional neural network for object localization. The augmentation techniques contribute to improved model generalization, while the pre-trained model architecture facilitates efficient learning.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the end-to-end process of implementing object localization using a custom dataset class, augmentation, and convolutional neural networks.
